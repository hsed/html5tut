  <div style="position: absolute; margin-left: 130px;"><p>The gateway of the modern era, HTML5 is slowly and steadily  changing the way we interact, visualise and access information on the web.  HTML5 is the fifth version of the de facto mark-up language (HTML) which is  used to display content on a webpage.</p></div>
  <h2><br /></h2>
  <h2><br /></h2>  
  <p>In the previous tutorial you were introduced to the syntax  of HTML. Over the past decade developers around the world that are part of the  W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) have significantly enhanced the standard  language (HTML4) bringing it newer capabilities especially in areas such as  multimedia, responsiveness and graphics. This edition (V5) is still under  development and newer features are finalized every few months. Simply put,  HTML5 has made creating amazing websites easier than ever before.</p>

  <h2>Some Benefits of HTML5</h2>
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="1">HTML5  does not require any kind of third-party installation on the local computer or  the web browser, it just works as long as the browser supports and recognizes  it.</li>
    <li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="2">Developers  can very easily create native 2D games using vectors as well as graphics with  support of the CANVAS tag. The game performance is automatically adjusted by  the browser depending on computer specs so that a wide variety of users can  play it without overloading their computer.</li>
    <li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="3">Animated  content especially mouse hover animations can be very easily created which will  be later discussed in this section and the next (CSS3).</li>
    <li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="4">Easy  access to storage capabilities for saving settings and a users&rsquo; progress.</li>
    <li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="5">Video  and audio (format dependant) can be easily play-backed on a browser without the  need of third party plugins such as Adobe® Flash.</li>
